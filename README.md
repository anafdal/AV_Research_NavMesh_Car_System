# AV_Research_NavMesh_Car_System
Spring 2020. Using NavMesh agents as cars and randonly generating them on diffeerent lanes. There is still work being done to get the Stoplights to work for all the cars. I am also testing pathfinding for the main car position. 

The solution is to be more specific with the waypoints and gave the cars more time to change distance which will be implemented in the future version.
